## Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports using nmap

This guide will show you how to use nmap to scan your local network for open ports. We will cover three common commands to help you identify active hosts, open ports, and service versions.

### 1\. The commands

  * *nmap -sS*: This performs a SYN stealth scan. It's fast and discreet because it doesn't complete the full TCP connection handshake. This scan is good for quickly checking which ports are open.

  * *nmap -sV -p-*: This command is more thorough.

      * -sV performs a service/version detection scan to determine what services are running on the open ports.
      * -p- scans all 65535 ports, not just the most common ones. This can take a significant amount of time but provides a complete picture of all open ports.

  * *nmap -sP*: This is a simple ping scan. It's used to determine which hosts on a network are online. It doesn't scan for open ports but is a good first step to identify live devices on your network.

### 2\. Usage

To run these commands, you need to have nmap installed on your system. You can install it on most Linux distributions using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, you would use:

bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap


On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

bash
brew install nmap


On Windows, you can download the installer from the official nmap website.

To run a scan, simply replace the IP address with the one you want to scan:

bash
nmap -sS <target_ip_address>
nmap -sV -p- <target_ip_address>
nmap -sP <target_ip_address>/24


  * The <target_ip_address> can be a single IP address, a range (e.g., 192.168.1.100-200), or a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
### 3\. Interpreting the Results
The output of nmap will provide information about each scanned host.
 * Host is up: The device is online and responded to the scan.
 * PORT: The port number and the protocol (e.g., 80/tcp).
 * STATE:
   * open: An application is listening for connections on this port.
   * closed: The port is accessible, but no application is listening.
   * filtered: A firewall is blocking the port.
 * SERVICE: The name of the service commonly associated with that port (e.g., http, ssh).
Example output for a successful scan on a router:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0020s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
